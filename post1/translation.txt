You want a niggun from the Tolner Hasidim?
At first, it seems to be a trifle, take a niggun from a Tolner, and eat of shalosh seudos and sing it. But this is not what it seems to be.
   The valley niggun must have been sung ברבֿ עם, a whole company must sing it!
   You want help? No, brother! With the help of Polish Hasidim, the song doesn't want to be sung!
