You want a valley tune?
At first, it seems to be a trifle, take a tune from a valley and accompany the eating of shalosh seudos. But this is not what it seems to be.
   The valley tune must have been sung (... something ...), a group of friends must sing it!
   You want help? No, brother! With the help of the Polish Hasidim you won't be singing any valley songs by yourself!
