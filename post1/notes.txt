I wasn't able to find the word ברבֿ in my dictionary. It is clearly a Hebrew or Aramaic derived word by the spelling, but searching it online as a hebrew word also didn't seem to get me any results.
In the final line of this I saw the word זינגט זיך I couldn't find this in the dictionary as a standard combination. זיך as I understand is both used in construct variants of verbs and to mean something like self. But I couldn't see clearly where such a word would fit. My guess was to say that the last sentence is talking about singing by yourself.
